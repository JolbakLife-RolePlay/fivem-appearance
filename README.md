Resource will be deleted, pending a pull request to https://github.com/pedr0fontoura/fivem-appearance that brings in several features, notably tattoos.

Maintaining this repository isn't enjoyable, which is why it's been pretty much ignored since the start.

I will be creating a resource to handle outfits, shops, saving data, etc. to work with the official fivem-appearance.
